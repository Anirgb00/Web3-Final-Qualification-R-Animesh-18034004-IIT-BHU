Requirements
Build the dashboard on "/dashboard" route
All the read values (e.g. price, supply, daily returns, tvl, etc) must work and show exact values as shown in Original Repo's existing code
Write operations (deposit, withdraw, redeem buttons etc) need to call and run the exact same functions as run on Original Repo's existing code
Be careful to call the correct function from the correct part, don't mix up claim and withdraw of different features
If UI front end development is not your strong suite, it is okay to not match the design 100% (e.g. you can make the design simple without gradients or other difficult elements if it's taking too much time). But we will be testing the functionality for sure, so make sure all functionalities work!
Try to write clean, elegant code with sensible class, function, and variable names that is well-commented.
After cloning, delete the old .git folder and start a new git repo going (as to get a fresh repo history on git without the old commits from cloning). Make sure to commit regularly with sensible commit messages, e.g. 1 feature = 1 commit.
